<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 1,4-Butanedicarboxylic Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cyclohexane Oxidation</li><li>Cyclohexene Oxidation</li><li>Phenol Hydrogenation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>1,4-Butanedicarboxylic Acid is primarily produced through two main processes: Cyclohexane Oxidation and Cyclohexene Oxidation. In the Cyclohexane Oxidation process, cyclohexane is oxidized to produce cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which are then oxidized to form 1,4-Butanedicarboxylic Acid. On the other hand, in the Cyclohexene Oxidation process, cyclohexene is oxidized directly to produce 1,4-Butanedicarboxylic Acid. Another method of producing 1,4-Butanedicarboxylic Acid is through Phenol Hydrogenation, where phenol is hydrogenated to form the desired compound.</p></p>
