<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Exhaust System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Engine Exhaust System</li><li>APU Exhaust System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aviation exhaust system market encompasses two main types: Engine Exhaust System and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Exhaust System. The Engine Exhaust System is crucial for directing and expelling hot gases produced during the combustion process in aircraft engines. On the other hand, the APU Exhaust System is responsible for expelling the exhaust gases generated by the auxiliary power unit, which is a smaller turbine engine used to provide power when the main engines are not operating. Both systems play a vital role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of aircraft.</p></p>
