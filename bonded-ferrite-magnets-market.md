<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bonded Ferrite Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injected Magnets</li><li>Pressed Magnets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bonded ferrite magnets are classified into two main types - injected magnets and pressed magnets. Injected magnets are created by injecting a mixture of ferrite powder and a polymer binder into a mold, making them suitable for complex shapes and high-volume production. Pressed magnets, on the other hand, are made by pressing the mixture of ferrite powder and binder into a specific shape using a die. Pressed magnets are preferred for high precision applications and have higher magnetic properties compared to injected magnets.</p></p>
