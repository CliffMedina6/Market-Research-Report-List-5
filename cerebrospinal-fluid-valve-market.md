<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed</li><li>Adjustable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cerebrospinal Fluid Valve Market offers two types of valves: Fixed and Adjustable. Fixed valves are pre-set to a specific pressure level and cannot be adjusted. Adjustable valves, on the other hand, provide the flexibility to change the pressure level post-surgery to cater to individual patient needs. While fixed valves offer simplicity and reliability, adjustable valves offer customization and adaptability. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the patient's condition and surgeon's preference.</p></p>
