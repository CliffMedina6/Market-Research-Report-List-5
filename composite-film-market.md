<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave</li><li>Out-of-autoclave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite films are commonly manufactured using two main processes- autoclave and out-of-autoclave. Autoclave is a traditional method where the film is cured under high pressure and heat inside an autoclave. This process is known for producing high-quality films with strong mechanical properties. On the other hand, out-of-autoclave methods involve curing the film outside of a pressurized autoclave, using alternative methods such as vacuum bagging or resin transfer molding. This process is more cost-effective and suitable for larger or complex film structures.</p></p>
