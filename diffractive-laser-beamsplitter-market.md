<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffractive Laser Beamsplitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-dimensional</li><li>two-dimensional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diffractive laser beamsplitters can be divided into two types: one-dimensional and two-dimensional. One-dimensional beamsplitters divide the laser beam into two separate beams in one direction, while two-dimensional beamsplitters split the laser beam into multiple beams in two directions. One-dimensional beamsplitters are commonly used for simple applications where only one beam division is needed, while two-dimensional beamsplitters are utilized for more complex applications requiring multiple beam divisions. Both types offer precise splitting of laser beams for various industrial and scientific purposes.</p></p>
