<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct-driven Wind Turbine Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct-driven wind turbine generators are classified into two types: Type I and Type II. Type I markets typically consist of small-scale residential and commercial wind turbine installations, where the generator is directly connected to the rotor without any gearbox. In contrast, Type II markets involve larger utility-scale wind turbine projects, where the generator is also directly driven by the rotor, but may incorporate a gearbox for efficiency at higher power capacities. Both types offer advantages in terms of reliability, simplicity, and maintenance.</p></p>
