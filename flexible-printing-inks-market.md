<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Printing Inks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible printing inks are classified into two main types: water-based and solvent-based inks. Water-based inks are environmentally friendly, as they have lower VOC emissions and are easy to clean up. They are ideal for food packaging and other applications where low odor and non-toxicity are important. On the other hand, solvent-based inks contain chemicals that evaporate quickly, making them suitable for printing on a wide range of substrates. While solvent-based inks are more durable, they are also associated with higher VOC emissions and environmental concerns.</p></p>
