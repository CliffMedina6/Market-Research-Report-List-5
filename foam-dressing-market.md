<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foam Dressing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adhesive Foam Dressing</li><li>Non-Adhesive Foam Dressing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foam dressings are a type of wound dressing that come in two main types: adhesive foam dressings and non-adhesive foam dressings. Adhesive foam dressings have a sticky backing that adheres to the skin around the wound, providing a secure and leak-proof seal. On the other hand, non-adhesive foam dressings do not have a sticky backing and are held in place with tape or a wrap. Both types of foam dressings are highly absorbent and provide a moist wound healing environment, promoting faster healing and preventing infections.</p></p>
