<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas-insulated Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full-insulated Transformers</li><li>Semi-insulated Transformers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas-insulated transformers have two main types: Full-insulated transformers and Semi-insulated transformers. Full-insulated transformers use gas as the insulating medium for both the transformer core and windings, providing high dielectric strength and efficient cooling. Semi-insulated transformers, on the other hand, only use gas insulation for the transformer core while the windings are insulated with solid material. Both types offer advantages in terms of compact design, improved safety, and reduced maintenance requirements compared to traditional oil-filled transformers.</p></p>
