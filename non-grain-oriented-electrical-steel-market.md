<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Grain-oriented Electrical Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Processed</li><li>Semi-processed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non grain-oriented electrical steel can be divided into two main types based on processing: fully processed and semi-processed. Fully processed steel has undergone extensive processing, including annealing and coating, to optimize its magnetic properties for use in electrical applications. On the other hand, semi-processed steel has undergone some processing but not to the same extent as fully processed steel. This distinction affects the performance and cost of the steel, with fully processed steel generally being more expensive but offering superior magnetic properties.</p></p>
