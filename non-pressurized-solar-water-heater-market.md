<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Pressurized Solar Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evacuated Tube</li><li>Flat Plate</li><li>Unglazed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-pressurized solar water heaters come in three main types: evacuated tube, flat plate, and unglazed. Evacuated tube systems use a series of glass tubes to absorb solar energy and heat the water inside. Flat plate systems consist of a dark absorber plate to collect sunlight and heat the water flowing through it. Unglazed systems are typically used for swimming pools and other non-potable water applications. Each type of system has its own advantages and is suitable for different climates and purposes.</p></p>
