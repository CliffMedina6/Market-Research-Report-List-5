<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peptide Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS)</li><li>Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peptide vaccines can be produced using Solution Phase Synthesis (SPS) or Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) methods. In SPS, the peptide is synthesized in a solution where the amino acids are added sequentially. SPPS involves attaching the first amino acid to a solid support and adding subsequent amino acids one by one in a stepwise manner. Both methods are widely used in the peptide vaccine market for their efficiency and ability to produce high-quality peptides for immunization.</p></p>
