<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Permeable Concrete Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Permeable concrete includes two main types: pervious concrete and porous asphalt. Pervious concrete is a type of concrete with high porosity that allows for water to pass through quickly, reducing stormwater runoff and promoting groundwater recharge. Porous asphalt is made with a porous mix that allows water to pass through the surface and into the soil below, reducing flooding and preventing pollutants from reaching water sources. Both types of permeable concrete are used to improve drainage, reduce erosion, and promote sustainable urban development.</p></p>
