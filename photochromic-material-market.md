<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photochromic Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic</li><li>Inorganic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photochromic materials can be classified into two main types: organic and inorganic. Organic photochromic materials are typically composed of carbon-based compounds and undergo reversible changes in their chemical structure when exposed to light, resulting in a change in color. Inorganic photochromic materials, on the other hand, are composed of non-carbon-based compounds such as metal oxides and undergo a similar reversible change in their structure when exposed to light. Both types of photochromic materials are used in applications such as sunglasses, smart windows, and sensors.</p></p>
