<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Ligation Clips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Type</li><li>Non-Absorbable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer ligation clips are classified into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable ligation clips are designed to degrade and get absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal. On the other hand, non-absorbable ligation clips are made from materials that are not absorbed by the body and may require removal after the healing process is complete. Both types offer advantages and are used in various surgical procedures based on the patient's needs and preferences.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Polymer Ligation Clips Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li><li>Open Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer ligation clips are widely used in both minimally invasive surgery and open surgery markets. In minimally invasive surgery, these clips provide a less invasive alternative to traditional sutures for closing wounds and sealing blood vessels. In open surgery, they offer a secure and efficient method for organ and tissue manipulation. The application of polymer ligation clips in both markets enhances surgical procedures by reducing operating time, improving patient outcomes, and minimizing the risk of complications.</p></p>
