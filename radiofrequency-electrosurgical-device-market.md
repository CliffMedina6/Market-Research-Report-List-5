<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency Electrosurgical Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Devices</li><li>Bipolar Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Radiofrequency Electrosurgical Device Market includes two main types of devices: Monopolar Devices and Bipolar Devices. Monopolar Devices use a single electrode for cutting or coagulating tissue, while the current flows through the patient's body to a grounding pad. Bipolar Devices, on the other hand, use two electrodes to minimize the risk of unintended damage to surrounding tissue by keeping the electrical current localized. Both types of devices offer precise control and are commonly used in various surgical procedures.</p></p>
