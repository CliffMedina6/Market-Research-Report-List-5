<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Photovoltaic Mounts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracking Mount</li><li>Fixed Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar photovoltaic mounts are used to support solar panels to maximize sunlight exposure and increase energy capture. There are two main types of mounts in the market: Tracking mounts and Fixed mounts. Tracking mounts move throughout the day to follow the sun's path, optimizing energy production. On the other hand, Fixed mounts remain stationary and are tilted at a fixed angle. While tracking mounts are more efficient, fixed mounts are more common due to lower cost and simplicity in design and installation.</p></p>
