<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suture market is divided into two main types: Absorbable and Non-absorbable sutures. Absorbable sutures are designed to dissolve over time as the wound heals, eliminating the need for removal. They are ideal for internal use and in areas with lower tension. Non-absorbable sutures do not dissolve and require removal after the wound has healed. They are commonly used in areas with higher tension or where long-term support is needed. Both types play a crucial role in surgical procedures, offering different benefits depending on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
