<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The UV-Visible Spectrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Beam UV-Vis Spectrophotometers</li><li>Double-Beam UV-Vis Spectrophotometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>UV-Visible spectrometers are used to measure the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by a sample. Single-beam UV-Vis spectrophotometers use a single beam of light passed through the sample and a reference solution. Double-beam UV-Vis spectrophotometers split the light beam into two paths- one passes through the sample and the other through a reference solution. This allows for continuous monitoring and correction of any fluctuations in the light source or detector, resulting in more accurate and reliable measurements.</p></p>
