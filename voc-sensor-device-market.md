<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Sensor Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VOC sensor devices are commonly classified into two main types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-oxide Semiconductor sensors. PID sensors use ultraviolet light to ionize gas molecules, making them ideal for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with high sensitivity. On the other hand, Metal-oxide Semiconductor sensors operate by detecting changes in electrical conductivity when VOCs come into contact with a thin film of metal oxide. Both types of sensors are widely used in industrial applications for monitoring air quality and ensuring workplace safety.</p></p>
